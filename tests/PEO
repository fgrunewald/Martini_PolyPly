; Note: in the original publication a force constant of 85 was used with a cosine-type angle potential (type 2).
;       Numerical stability is improved when a normal harmonic angle potential (type 1) is used with a force constant of 50.
;       The two potentials are virtually identical around the equilibrium angle, but the probability density of 
;       angles around 180 degrees is lowered avoiding problems with the dihedral angles becoming ill-defined.
